learning how to clone any respository of github to my local machine (vs code)
for that we use command:
#syntax
*git clone <respository linK>*

using git status command.

it is used to check if there is any changes in the respository or not. 

4 types of changes it catches.

1.Unchanged
when there is no change in file.

2. Untracked
when a new file is created that git don't track called untracked.

3. modified.
when something changes in exisiting file.

4. Staged
when we add the modified or newfile is the state of file called staged after commit the staged file will become unchanged.
